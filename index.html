	<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
	<P>Test paragraph so I can try to understand coding. Just typing random stuff because I need to understand this crazy ass shit jesus Christ this is so weird and difficult idk someone help I aint grown but let me just keep typing random stuff so that this looks like a paragraph and not a nutass list.</p>
	<P> Second paragraph so that I can test this out and underatnd it smh..I am so extra. going to need to keep typing more random ass boulshit because I need to fill in all this empty space just like I put random knowledge into my brain to fill up all the empty space I have chilling in there with no brain cells in existence.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<P> Testing the different sections because I think I am starting to remotely understand this kinda sorta idk maybe I guess we will see in a few hours when I try to retain the information without using a youtube video with some nutass dude to hold my hand and walk me through it step by step and baby me.</p>
	<P> And here we have another random paragraph. Hi my name is Keara Barber and I am 24 years old and I have achieved little to nothing in my life, I have $20 in my bank account and am behind on my electric bill...my rent is paid and my car is paid so I guess that is a plus but sadly my credit score is now fucked and my cats dont get Christmas gifts this year.</p>

	<h2>My business</h2>
	<P>I own a business which is called KB's Super Swimmers...I low key regret naming it that because it sounds like KB has super sperms that swim around and it is just all around kind of weird but its fine because I am still proud of my business. I teach anyone 3mo old and older. The oldest person I have ever taught was 83 years old and she did learn to swim freestyle and backstroke. The youngest person I have ever taught was 2.5mo old and his name was Uri. He could go under and hold his breath for 15 seconds.</p>
