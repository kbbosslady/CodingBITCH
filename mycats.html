<P>Manski is the next in line and is a shithead who likes to piss on my stuff 24/7. He also always looks surprised which is his cutest quality.</p>

<P>Galaxy is the baby and she has cutie eyes. I want to squish her face until her eyeballs pop out and then I want to eat her ribs like french fries and then I want to eat her tail like a twizzler and bite her little feet like chicken wings and then rip off her head and drink her blood because shes so fucking cute. Also she likes me better than Koffi despite what he says.</p>
